            We'll start of by creating 3 divs, each with their own id.
            The first one will have an ID value of header
            The second one will have an ID value of main
            The third one will have an ID value of footer

            We'll add content to these divs later on, but first let's
            get into how media queries work a bit by introducing a
            neat way to troubleshoot them in our css.
