                    I write short, fun articles about the
                    journeys I take as a photographer.

         <!--
            Now, let's create another div. We'll give this
            div a class of featured.

            Then, let's add an h2 that says "Featured Photo",
            and one more div next/beneath the h2 with a class
            of "grid". We're going to create a fun grid system
            that also is responsive.

            Inside of our div with a class of grid, let's add
            a paragraph element with an id of "p1" and put
            "Some of my favorite photos" for it's content.

            After the p element, we'll add 3 image elements,
            each with an id of img1, img2, and img3.
         -->
         <div class="featured">
            <h2>Featured Photos</h2>
            <div class="grid">
                <p id="p1">Some of my favorite photos</p>
                <img src="" alt="photo" id="img1">
                <img src="" alt="photo" id="img2">
                <img src="" alt="photo" id="img3">
                <p id="p2">Photography is fun!</p>
