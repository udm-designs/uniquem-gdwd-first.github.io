    Now, let's target our anchor elements. Anyone remember
    how we can target the anchor elements that only reside
    within a div that has a class of nav?

    Let's give it a color of white, a text-decoration of 
    none, top and bottom padding of 20px and left and right
    margin of 10px.

    We'll also target what's called a psuedo-class by
    typing .nav a and attaching :last-of-type at the end
    of the a with no spaces. The last-of-type psuedo-class
    targets the last element of it's type in a group of 
    siblings, in this case, it's targeting the last anchor
    element in a group of anchor elements.

    We need this css rule to prevent the last anchor element
    from having margin on the right of it to avoid having
    our elements not fully centered. We would have to do
    something similar with margin-left, however, we'd be
    calling the :first-of-type rather than the last.
