            <h3>Cards in a Two Column Layout</h3>
            <!-- Two Cards Section -->
            <!-- 
                The section wills contain our cards, allowing us to create a multi-column layout with our cards. We can give this section an ID to differentiate it from other sections that may utilize multi-column layouts and/or cards.

                The cards themselves are made up of a overall parent container: the div with a class and id. The id will allow us to add and edit styles on that specific card while the class will allow us to add and edit styles for all of the cards inside of this section.

                The card is made up of an image container with an img element inside of it, a heading element, a paragraph elemnent, and a link or button element.

                By default, our img elements are inline and will come in at their default size. This can often be too large or small for the overall container. To deal with this, we can wrap our img element in a div which will act as a container for that element once the appropriate styles are applied. Divs are block element by default and will take up 100% of it's parent's width. This makes it much easier to create cards with images.
